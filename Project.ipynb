Jeremy Teoh, Neal Shore, and Badrinath Konety discussing whether skill urologists really need to perform re-TUR for all high-grade patients. As moderator, Dr. Shore started by presenting a case of a 65-year-old patient that presented with a solitary 2 cm papillary lesion with surrounding erythema on the lateral wall. His medical history included a two pack per day smoker for 15 years (quit 15 years ago), but he is now vaping, and he is 20 kg overweight. He previously worked in a steel mill and is now a compliance officer for a pharmaceutical company. He eventually underwent a complete resection TURBT, but had a thin bladder wall, as well as a difficult post-anesthesia recovery. Dr. Shore polled the audience with the following question: \\u201cDo skilled urologists really need to perform a re-TUR for all high grade patients?\\u201d with the following results:\\n\\nYes: 28%\\nOnly T1: 55%\\nNo: 17%\\n\\nDr. Teoh started by taking the stance of no need for repeat TURBT. From a surgical perspective, CIS and early cancer changes can be subtle, it can be difficult to determine the resection margin based on white light imaging alone, and difficult to ensure a uniform resection at the detrusor muscle level. Thus, the end result is residual disease. According to the AUA guidelines specific to a repeat TURBT, the following statements are made:\\n\\nGuideline statement 12: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\nGuideline Statement 13: In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C)\\nGuideline Statement 14: In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\n\\nDr. Teoh raised several important questions, including (1) Why do we need a second surgery to compensate for the first surgery? (2) Why do we think that a second surgery would be easier than the first surgery? With en bloc resection of specimens, both circumferential and deep resection margins can be inked and assessed, as well as the depth of tumor invasion be ascertained. Importantly, proper staging and complete tumor resection can be achieved:\\n\\nDr. Teoh was the lead author of a recently published phase 3 randomized trial assessing transurethral en bloc resection versus standard resection of bladder tumors.1 The EB-StaR study was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Hong Kong. There were 350 patients with bladder tumor(s) of \\u22643 cm recruited from April 2017 to December 2020 and followed up until 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was 1-year recurrence rate. Overall 276 patients were confirmed to have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including 143 patients in the en bloc resection group and 133 patients in the standard resection group. At 1 year, 31 patients in the en bloc resection group and 46 in the standard resection group developed recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year recurrence rates was 29% (95% CI 18\\u201337) in the en bloc resection group and 38% (95% CI 28\\u201346) in the standard resection group (p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.007):\\n\\nThe forest plot shows that patients with 1-3 cm tumors, single tumors, Ta disease, or intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer had a significant benefit from en bloc resection:\\n\\nDr. Teoh notes that the modified ERBT study is a phase 2 single arm study using modified en block resection. Key inclusion criteria include bladder tumors >= 3 cm, and assuming a >90% rate of complete resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 30 patients were to be recruited. The primary outcome is complete resection and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04081246). One case example from this trial is as follows:\\n\\nAmong 28 cases of modified en bloc resection, one case of prostate cancer was excluded, finding 15 cases of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (with 14 cases of complete resection \\u2013 93.3%), and 12 cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (11 had proper staging of muscle invasive disease at the first surgery \\u2013 91.7%). Ultimately 8 patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, with four patients having T2 disease ultimately having T0 disease on final pathologic staging. The remaining four patients had pT3 disease. Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases.\\u00a0\\nDr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts:\\n\\nConventional TURBT is associated with major limitations\\nSecond/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery\\nIn the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered?\\nA good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease\\n\\nDr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT:\\n\\nAUA:\\n\\nIncomplete resection (Grade B)\\nAll T1 lesions (Grade B)\\nRecurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C)\\n\\n\\nICUD:\\n\\nIncomplete initial resection\\nT1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection\\nHigh grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal\\n\\n\\nEAU (Grade A):\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nAbsence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta)\\nAll high grade Ta and T1 lesions\\n\\n\\nNCCN:\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nT1\\nLarge and multifocal\\nNo muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta\\n\\n\\n\\nThe quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to \\u2265T1) and 0-32% (T1 to \\u2265T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT).\\nDr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001):\\n\\nIs a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology:\\u00a0\\n\\nHistorical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%).\\nDr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions:\\n\\nThere is more complete information up front with re-TURBT\\nThere is better patient selection for BCG\\nIt drives better cystectomy decision making\\nIt improves disease related outcomes\\nIt may improve overall survival\\nEn bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT\\u00a0\\n\\nModerator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC\\nDebaters:\\u00a0\\n\\nJeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\\nBadrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN\\u00a0\\n\\nWritten by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc \\u2013 Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during\\u00a0the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 \\u2013 Mon, May 6, 2024.\\u00a0\\n\",\n          \"Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer. Dr. Khan's study, leveraging data from Invitae, explores genetic testing results linked to medical records to identify gene-specific associations and potential disparities in testing among diverse populations. Key findings reveal that BRCA2 is the most common mutation across all demographics and is associated with advanced disease, while BRCA1 and MMR mutations are often linked to less aggressive prostate cancer and detected before diagnosis. Notably, only 25% of patients had a documented family history prompting genetic testing, underscoring the need for broader screening based on personal cancer history. Dr. Khan emphasizes the importance of large, inclusive studies to ensure equitable access to genetic testing and targeted therapies, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities in prostate cancer care.  Biographies:Hiba Khan, MD, MPH, GU Medical Oncologist, Assistant Professor, Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAndrea K. Miyahira, PhD, Director of Global Research & Scientific Communications, The Prostate Cancer Foundation Andrea Miyahira: Hi everyone. I'm Andrea Miyahira here at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Joining me today is Dr. Hiba Khan, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Khan just presented a poster at ASCO on germline genetic associations in a large prostate cancer cohort. Dr. Khan, thanks so much for joining us today.Hiba Khan: Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here.Andrea Miyahira: Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable types of cancer, with over 50% having a genetic component. Many DNA repair mutations have been identified in the germline, most commonly BRCA2, and this has led to recommendations for all patients with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer to receive germline testing. This is important so that patients can know whether they're eligible for PARP inhibitors, but also to trigger cascade genetic testing. So, what were you specifically looking at in this study?Hiba Khan: In this study, we wanted to take advantage of a large database that was available to us through Invitae, which is one of the largest companies that does germline genetic testing commercially. They had great linkage with a medical records database that allowed us to access coding records along with genetic testing results, and there was a linkage between them. The idea for the study was to see if we could identify some gene-specific associations, including things like population trends, demographic trends, and perhaps geographic distributions that could give us some idea of populations that were perhaps being left behind in testing or to get a broader equity, diversity lens to see where we can make the most impact for the most populations.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. Can you describe the patient cohort, including the racial and ethnic demographics, how patients were selected, and how germline testing was done?Hiba Khan: Yes. This was commercial testing, so they had results for most of the genetic testing that they had done. Any patient that had a prostate cancer code and had undergone genetic testing was included in the cohort. The cohort was predominantly an older population. The median age was 64. The patients were primarily of white background; 66% were white. We had 11% Black or African American ancestry, and about 4% were Hispanic or identified as Latino.Andrea Miyahira: What were your major findings on pathogenic germline alterations? Was there anything that surprised you?Hiba Khan: Yes, the major finding was, I would say, not a surprising one, which, as you stated earlier, BRCA2 is known to be a very common heritable mutation that can serve as a driver for prostate cancer. And so that was the most common mutation we found across all racial ethnic groups and geographic distributions. We also found that BRCA2 was associated with more advanced and metastatic disease, also not a surprising finding.There were a couple of findings that were interesting to me. One of those was that patients with BRCA1 and MMR mutations actually tended to have less aggressive disease. In addition, those patients with BRCA1 and MMR gene mutations, many of them were screened before their prostate cancer diagnosis. So they were found to have had these mutations and then later subsequently developed prostate cancer. So those two things in combination make me think: were those patients perhaps getting screened for prostate cancer more than the average population? Those were a couple of surprising findings. The other major finding was that only a quarter, or 25%, of our patients in the cohort had a code for family history of prostate cancer, which drove the genetic testing. The rest of the patients were screened based on only personal history of prostate cancer.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. We've seen in studies from Asia that driver alterations can be significantly different than studies performed in predominantly European ancestry populations. So what was the frequency of Asian and other underrepresented populations in this study?Hiba Khan: We did not actually have a very large Asian cohort. Only about 2% of our patients in the cohort were Asian. So it was very difficult to sort of make gene-specific associations and find those trends in the Asian population. What is interesting, though, is that about 10% of the cohort had an unclear race. They were either unknown or it was left completely blank. So I wonder if some of those patients were perhaps other minorities that we weren't capturing. It could include Asian populations, it could have been Native American populations or patients of mixed race ancestry and background that we're not capturing.So, again, it drives home the importance of conducting these kinds of large population-based studies and including race, ethnic background, and similar information so that we can see what the trends are and be able to intervene appropriately if we see that a population's needs aren't being met, to just ensure equitable, both genetic testing, and as you, again, said earlier, just precision-based treatment with PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy.Andrea Miyahira: Can you contrast germline testing with other methods such as polygenic risk score for identifying patients at risk?Hiba Khan: Yes. I think polygenic risk scores are very interesting, and I think we're learning a lot about how we can use them, again, on a very large population-based level. There's some great work being done currently at Fred Hutch Cancer Center to look at how we can use polygenic risk scores in a large population-based manner. I think we're still learning about them, and I think germline genetic testing can be in concert with polygenic risk scores, and we can use them simultaneously.Andrea Miyahira: And what are you and your team doing next in this study?Hiba Khan: I think it'll be really important, actually, to use that really great data to look at treatments and actually outcomes. That's kind of an interest of mine, is to see if we can identify disparities, can we drive a little bit further and see if there are disparities in treatments or disparities in just large populations like we have to see where if it impacts treatment and outcomes in the future. So I think that's one next step of this study. And then in the future, I think we can use all this information we're gathering to hopefully drive some interventions forward to make cancer care and prostate cancer care in general more equitable.Andrea Miyahira: Thanks. What would be your key take-home messages for patients and providers?Hiba Khan: One thing that was really interesting that we found in this study was only a quarter of patients actually had a family history that was coded for. So again, as the guidelines suggest, it just drives home the importance of doing genetic testing, germline genetic testing based on personal prostate cancer history and risk. My ultimate hope is that the more patients we can get tested and screened, not only will they be eligible, potentially, for precision therapies, but we can also screen their family members and loved ones through cascade testing to hopefully find more people who have these germline genetic mutations to impact screening and ultimately the development of prostate cancer and help make a dent in prostate cancer outcomes.Andrea Miyahira: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Khan, for joining me. It was really a pleasure.Hiba Khan: Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Google Scholar\",\n          \"CancerNetwork\",\n          \"Urology Today\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Research Articles\",\n          \"Media Sources\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.urotoday.com//conference-highlights/aua-2024/aua-2024-bladder-cancer/151890-aua-2024-optimal-turbt-do-skilled-urologists-really-need-to-perform-retur-for-all-hg-patients.html\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38160916/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Published date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2022-06-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-06-29 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-04-30 00:00:00\",\n          \"2024-06-01 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Jeremy Teoh, Neal Shore, and Badrinath Konety discussing whether skill urologists really need to perform re-TUR for all high-grade patients. As moderator, Dr. Shore started by presenting a case of a 65-year-old patient that presented with a solitary 2 cm papillary lesion with surrounding erythema on the lateral wall. His medical history included a two pack per day smoker for 15 years (quit 15 years ago), but he is now vaping, and he is 20 kg overweight. He previously worked in a steel mill and is now a compliance officer for a pharmaceutical company. He eventually underwent a complete resection TURBT, but had a thin bladder wall, as well as a difficult post-anesthesia recovery. Dr. Shore polled the audience with the following question: \\u201cDo skilled urologists really need to perform a re-TUR for all high grade patients?\\u201d with the following results:\\n\\nYes: 28%\\nOnly T1: 55%\\nNo: 17%\\n\\nDr. Teoh started by taking the stance of no need for repeat TURBT. From a surgical perspective, CIS and early cancer changes can be subtle, it can be difficult to determine the resection margin based on white light imaging alone, and difficult to ensure a uniform resection at the detrusor muscle level. Thus, the end result is residual disease. According to the AUA guidelines specific to a repeat TURBT, the following statements are made:\\n\\nGuideline statement 12: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\nGuideline Statement 13: In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C)\\nGuideline Statement 14: In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\n\\nDr. Teoh raised several important questions, including (1) Why do we need a second surgery to compensate for the first surgery? (2) Why do we think that a second surgery would be easier than the first surgery? With en bloc resection of specimens, both circumferential and deep resection margins can be inked and assessed, as well as the depth of tumor invasion be ascertained. Importantly, proper staging and complete tumor resection can be achieved:\\n\\nDr. Teoh was the lead author of a recently published phase 3 randomized trial assessing transurethral en bloc resection versus standard resection of bladder tumors.1 The EB-StaR study was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Hong Kong. There were 350 patients with bladder tumor(s) of \\u22643 cm recruited from April 2017 to December 2020 and followed up until 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was 1-year recurrence rate. Overall 276 patients were confirmed to have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including 143 patients in the en bloc resection group and 133 patients in the standard resection group. At 1 year, 31 patients in the en bloc resection group and 46 in the standard resection group developed recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year recurrence rates was 29% (95% CI 18\\u201337) in the en bloc resection group and 38% (95% CI 28\\u201346) in the standard resection group (p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.007):\\n\\nThe forest plot shows that patients with 1-3 cm tumors, single tumors, Ta disease, or intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer had a significant benefit from en bloc resection:\\n\\nDr. Teoh notes that the modified ERBT study is a phase 2 single arm study using modified en block resection. Key inclusion criteria include bladder tumors >= 3 cm, and assuming a >90% rate of complete resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 30 patients were to be recruited. The primary outcome is complete resection and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04081246). One case example from this trial is as follows:\\n\\nAmong 28 cases of modified en bloc resection, one case of prostate cancer was excluded, finding 15 cases of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (with 14 cases of complete resection \\u2013 93.3%), and 12 cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (11 had proper staging of muscle invasive disease at the first surgery \\u2013 91.7%). Ultimately 8 patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, with four patients having T2 disease ultimately having T0 disease on final pathologic staging. The remaining four patients had pT3 disease. Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases.\\u00a0\\nDr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts:\\n\\nConventional TURBT is associated with major limitations\\nSecond/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery\\nIn the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered?\\nA good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease\\n\\nDr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT:\\n\\nAUA:\\n\\nIncomplete resection (Grade B)\\nAll T1 lesions (Grade B)\\nRecurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C)\\n\\n\\nICUD:\\n\\nIncomplete initial resection\\nT1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection\\nHigh grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal\\n\\n\\nEAU (Grade A):\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nAbsence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta)\\nAll high grade Ta and T1 lesions\\n\\n\\nNCCN:\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nT1\\nLarge and multifocal\\nNo muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta\\n\\n\\n\\nThe quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to \\u2265T1) and 0-32% (T1 to \\u2265T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT).\\nDr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001):\\n\\nIs a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology:\\u00a0\\n\\nHistorical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%).\\nDr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions:\\n\\nThere is more complete information up front with re-TURBT\\nThere is better patient selection for BCG\\nIt drives better cystectomy decision making\\nIt improves disease related outcomes\\nIt may improve overall survival\\nEn bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT\\u00a0\\n\\nModerator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC\\nDebaters:\\u00a0\\n\\nJeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\\nBadrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN\\u00a0\\n\\nWritten by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc \\u2013 Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during\\u00a0the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 \\u2013 Mon, May 6, 2024.\\u00a0\\n\",\n          \"Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer. Dr. Khan's study, leveraging data from Invitae, explores genetic testing results linked to medical records to identify gene-specific associations and potential disparities in testing among diverse populations. Key findings reveal that BRCA2 is the most common mutation across all demographics and is associated with advanced disease, while BRCA1 and MMR mutations are often linked to less aggressive prostate cancer and detected before diagnosis. Notably, only 25% of patients had a documented family history prompting genetic testing, underscoring the need for broader screening based on personal cancer history. Dr. Khan emphasizes the importance of large, inclusive studies to ensure equitable access to genetic testing and targeted therapies, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities in prostate cancer care.  Biographies:Hiba Khan, MD, MPH, GU Medical Oncologist, Assistant Professor, Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAndrea K. Miyahira, PhD, Director of Global Research & Scientific Communications, The Prostate Cancer Foundation Andrea Miyahira: Hi everyone. I'm Andrea Miyahira here at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Joining me today is Dr. Hiba Khan, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Khan just presented a poster at ASCO on germline genetic associations in a large prostate cancer cohort. Dr. Khan, thanks so much for joining us today.Hiba Khan: Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here.Andrea Miyahira: Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable types of cancer, with over 50% having a genetic component. Many DNA repair mutations have been identified in the germline, most commonly BRCA2, and this has led to recommendations for all patients with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer to receive germline testing. This is important so that patients can know whether they're eligible for PARP inhibitors, but also to trigger cascade genetic testing. So, what were you specifically looking at in this study?Hiba Khan: In this study, we wanted to take advantage of a large database that was available to us through Invitae, which is one of the largest companies that does germline genetic testing commercially. They had great linkage with a medical records database that allowed us to access coding records along with genetic testing results, and there was a linkage between them. The idea for the study was to see if we could identify some gene-specific associations, including things like population trends, demographic trends, and perhaps geographic distributions that could give us some idea of populations that were perhaps being left behind in testing or to get a broader equity, diversity lens to see where we can make the most impact for the most populations.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. Can you describe the patient cohort, including the racial and ethnic demographics, how patients were selected, and how germline testing was done?Hiba Khan: Yes. This was commercial testing, so they had results for most of the genetic testing that they had done. Any patient that had a prostate cancer code and had undergone genetic testing was included in the cohort. The cohort was predominantly an older population. The median age was 64. The patients were primarily of white background; 66% were white. We had 11% Black or African American ancestry, and about 4% were Hispanic or identified as Latino.Andrea Miyahira: What were your major findings on pathogenic germline alterations? Was there anything that surprised you?Hiba Khan: Yes, the major finding was, I would say, not a surprising one, which, as you stated earlier, BRCA2 is known to be a very common heritable mutation that can serve as a driver for prostate cancer. And so that was the most common mutation we found across all racial ethnic groups and geographic distributions. We also found that BRCA2 was associated with more advanced and metastatic disease, also not a surprising finding.There were a couple of findings that were interesting to me. One of those was that patients with BRCA1 and MMR mutations actually tended to have less aggressive disease. In addition, those patients with BRCA1 and MMR gene mutations, many of them were screened before their prostate cancer diagnosis. So they were found to have had these mutations and then later subsequently developed prostate cancer. So those two things in combination make me think: were those patients perhaps getting screened for prostate cancer more than the average population? Those were a couple of surprising findings. The other major finding was that only a quarter, or 25%, of our patients in the cohort had a code for family history of prostate cancer, which drove the genetic testing. The rest of the patients were screened based on only personal history of prostate cancer.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. We've seen in studies from Asia that driver alterations can be significantly different than studies performed in predominantly European ancestry populations. So what was the frequency of Asian and other underrepresented populations in this study?Hiba Khan: We did not actually have a very large Asian cohort. Only about 2% of our patients in the cohort were Asian. So it was very difficult to sort of make gene-specific associations and find those trends in the Asian population. What is interesting, though, is that about 10% of the cohort had an unclear race. They were either unknown or it was left completely blank. So I wonder if some of those patients were perhaps other minorities that we weren't capturing. It could include Asian populations, it could have been Native American populations or patients of mixed race ancestry and background that we're not capturing.So, again, it drives home the importance of conducting these kinds of large population-based studies and including race, ethnic background, and similar information so that we can see what the trends are and be able to intervene appropriately if we see that a population's needs aren't being met, to just ensure equitable, both genetic testing, and as you, again, said earlier, just precision-based treatment with PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy.Andrea Miyahira: Can you contrast germline testing with other methods such as polygenic risk score for identifying patients at risk?Hiba Khan: Yes. I think polygenic risk scores are very interesting, and I think we're learning a lot about how we can use them, again, on a very large population-based level. There's some great work being done currently at Fred Hutch Cancer Center to look at how we can use polygenic risk scores in a large population-based manner. I think we're still learning about them, and I think germline genetic testing can be in concert with polygenic risk scores, and we can use them simultaneously.Andrea Miyahira: And what are you and your team doing next in this study?Hiba Khan: I think it'll be really important, actually, to use that really great data to look at treatments and actually outcomes. That's kind of an interest of mine, is to see if we can identify disparities, can we drive a little bit further and see if there are disparities in treatments or disparities in just large populations like we have to see where if it impacts treatment and outcomes in the future. So I think that's one next step of this study. And then in the future, I think we can use all this information we're gathering to hopefully drive some interventions forward to make cancer care and prostate cancer care in general more equitable.Andrea Miyahira: Thanks. What would be your key take-home messages for patients and providers?Hiba Khan: One thing that was really interesting that we found in this study was only a quarter of patients actually had a family history that was coded for. So again, as the guidelines suggest, it just drives home the importance of doing genetic testing, germline genetic testing based on personal prostate cancer history and risk. My ultimate hope is that the more patients we can get tested and screened, not only will they be eligible, potentially, for precision therapies, but we can also screen their family members and loved ones through cascade testing to hopefully find more people who have these germline genetic mutations to impact screening and ultimately the development of prostate cancer and help make a dent in prostate cancer outcomes.Andrea Miyahira: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Khan, for joining me. It was really a pleasure.Hiba Khan: Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Google Scholar\",\n          \"CancerNetwork\",\n          \"Urology Today\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Research Articles\",\n          \"Media Sources\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.urotoday.com//conference-highlights/aua-2024/aua-2024-bladder-cancer/151890-aua-2024-optimal-turbt-do-skilled-urologists-really-need-to-perform-retur-for-all-hg-patients.html\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38160916/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Published date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2022-06-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-06-29 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-04-30 00:00:00\",\n          \"2024-06-01 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Jeremy Teoh, Neal Shore, and Badrinath Konety discussing whether skill urologists really need to perform re-TUR for all high-grade patients. As moderator, Dr. Shore started by presenting a case of a 65-year-old patient that presented with a solitary 2 cm papillary lesion with surrounding erythema on the lateral wall. His medical history included a two pack per day smoker for 15 years (quit 15 years ago), but he is now vaping, and he is 20 kg overweight. He previously worked in a steel mill and is now a compliance officer for a pharmaceutical company. He eventually underwent a complete resection TURBT, but had a thin bladder wall, as well as a difficult post-anesthesia recovery. Dr. Shore polled the audience with the following question: \\u201cDo skilled urologists really need to perform a re-TUR for all high grade patients?\\u201d with the following results:\\n\\nYes: 28%\\nOnly T1: 55%\\nNo: 17%\\n\\nDr. Teoh started by taking the stance of no need for repeat TURBT. From a surgical perspective, CIS and early cancer changes can be subtle, it can be difficult to determine the resection margin based on white light imaging alone, and difficult to ensure a uniform resection at the detrusor muscle level. Thus, the end result is residual disease. According to the AUA guidelines specific to a repeat TURBT, the following statements are made:\\n\\nGuideline statement 12: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\nGuideline Statement 13: In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C)\\nGuideline Statement 14: In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\n\\nDr. Teoh raised several important questions, including (1) Why do we need a second surgery to compensate for the first surgery? (2) Why do we think that a second surgery would be easier than the first surgery? With en bloc resection of specimens, both circumferential and deep resection margins can be inked and assessed, as well as the depth of tumor invasion be ascertained. Importantly, proper staging and complete tumor resection can be achieved:\\n\\nDr. Teoh was the lead author of a recently published phase 3 randomized trial assessing transurethral en bloc resection versus standard resection of bladder tumors.1 The EB-StaR study was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Hong Kong. There were 350 patients with bladder tumor(s) of \\u22643 cm recruited from April 2017 to December 2020 and followed up until 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was 1-year recurrence rate. Overall 276 patients were confirmed to have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including 143 patients in the en bloc resection group and 133 patients in the standard resection group. At 1 year, 31 patients in the en bloc resection group and 46 in the standard resection group developed recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year recurrence rates was 29% (95% CI 18\\u201337) in the en bloc resection group and 38% (95% CI 28\\u201346) in the standard resection group (p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.007):\\n\\nThe forest plot shows that patients with 1-3 cm tumors, single tumors, Ta disease, or intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer had a significant benefit from en bloc resection:\\n\\nDr. Teoh notes that the modified ERBT study is a phase 2 single arm study using modified en block resection. Key inclusion criteria include bladder tumors >= 3 cm, and assuming a >90% rate of complete resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 30 patients were to be recruited. The primary outcome is complete resection and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04081246). One case example from this trial is as follows:\\n\\nAmong 28 cases of modified en bloc resection, one case of prostate cancer was excluded, finding 15 cases of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (with 14 cases of complete resection \\u2013 93.3%), and 12 cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (11 had proper staging of muscle invasive disease at the first surgery \\u2013 91.7%). Ultimately 8 patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, with four patients having T2 disease ultimately having T0 disease on final pathologic staging. The remaining four patients had pT3 disease. Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases.\\u00a0\\nDr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts:\\n\\nConventional TURBT is associated with major limitations\\nSecond/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery\\nIn the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered?\\nA good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease\\n\\nDr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT:\\n\\nAUA:\\n\\nIncomplete resection (Grade B)\\nAll T1 lesions (Grade B)\\nRecurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C)\\n\\n\\nICUD:\\n\\nIncomplete initial resection\\nT1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection\\nHigh grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal\\n\\n\\nEAU (Grade A):\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nAbsence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta)\\nAll high grade Ta and T1 lesions\\n\\n\\nNCCN:\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nT1\\nLarge and multifocal\\nNo muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta\\n\\n\\n\\nThe quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to \\u2265T1) and 0-32% (T1 to \\u2265T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT).\\nDr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001):\\n\\nIs a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology:\\u00a0\\n\\nHistorical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%).\\nDr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions:\\n\\nThere is more complete information up front with re-TURBT\\nThere is better patient selection for BCG\\nIt drives better cystectomy decision making\\nIt improves disease related outcomes\\nIt may improve overall survival\\nEn bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT\\u00a0\\n\\nModerator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC\\nDebaters:\\u00a0\\n\\nJeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\\nBadrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN\\u00a0\\n\\nWritten by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc \\u2013 Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during\\u00a0the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 \\u2013 Mon, May 6, 2024.\\u00a0\\n\",\n          \"Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer. Dr. Khan's study, leveraging data from Invitae, explores genetic testing results linked to medical records to identify gene-specific associations and potential disparities in testing among diverse populations. Key findings reveal that BRCA2 is the most common mutation across all demographics and is associated with advanced disease, while BRCA1 and MMR mutations are often linked to less aggressive prostate cancer and detected before diagnosis. Notably, only 25% of patients had a documented family history prompting genetic testing, underscoring the need for broader screening based on personal cancer history. Dr. Khan emphasizes the importance of large, inclusive studies to ensure equitable access to genetic testing and targeted therapies, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities in prostate cancer care.  Biographies:Hiba Khan, MD, MPH, GU Medical Oncologist, Assistant Professor, Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAndrea K. Miyahira, PhD, Director of Global Research & Scientific Communications, The Prostate Cancer Foundation Andrea Miyahira: Hi everyone. I'm Andrea Miyahira here at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Joining me today is Dr. Hiba Khan, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Khan just presented a poster at ASCO on germline genetic associations in a large prostate cancer cohort. Dr. Khan, thanks so much for joining us today.Hiba Khan: Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here.Andrea Miyahira: Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable types of cancer, with over 50% having a genetic component. Many DNA repair mutations have been identified in the germline, most commonly BRCA2, and this has led to recommendations for all patients with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer to receive germline testing. This is important so that patients can know whether they're eligible for PARP inhibitors, but also to trigger cascade genetic testing. So, what were you specifically looking at in this study?Hiba Khan: In this study, we wanted to take advantage of a large database that was available to us through Invitae, which is one of the largest companies that does germline genetic testing commercially. They had great linkage with a medical records database that allowed us to access coding records along with genetic testing results, and there was a linkage between them. The idea for the study was to see if we could identify some gene-specific associations, including things like population trends, demographic trends, and perhaps geographic distributions that could give us some idea of populations that were perhaps being left behind in testing or to get a broader equity, diversity lens to see where we can make the most impact for the most populations.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. Can you describe the patient cohort, including the racial and ethnic demographics, how patients were selected, and how germline testing was done?Hiba Khan: Yes. This was commercial testing, so they had results for most of the genetic testing that they had done. Any patient that had a prostate cancer code and had undergone genetic testing was included in the cohort. The cohort was predominantly an older population. The median age was 64. The patients were primarily of white background; 66% were white. We had 11% Black or African American ancestry, and about 4% were Hispanic or identified as Latino.Andrea Miyahira: What were your major findings on pathogenic germline alterations? Was there anything that surprised you?Hiba Khan: Yes, the major finding was, I would say, not a surprising one, which, as you stated earlier, BRCA2 is known to be a very common heritable mutation that can serve as a driver for prostate cancer. And so that was the most common mutation we found across all racial ethnic groups and geographic distributions. We also found that BRCA2 was associated with more advanced and metastatic disease, also not a surprising finding.There were a couple of findings that were interesting to me. One of those was that patients with BRCA1 and MMR mutations actually tended to have less aggressive disease. In addition, those patients with BRCA1 and MMR gene mutations, many of them were screened before their prostate cancer diagnosis. So they were found to have had these mutations and then later subsequently developed prostate cancer. So those two things in combination make me think: were those patients perhaps getting screened for prostate cancer more than the average population? Those were a couple of surprising findings. The other major finding was that only a quarter, or 25%, of our patients in the cohort had a code for family history of prostate cancer, which drove the genetic testing. The rest of the patients were screened based on only personal history of prostate cancer.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. We've seen in studies from Asia that driver alterations can be significantly different than studies performed in predominantly European ancestry populations. So what was the frequency of Asian and other underrepresented populations in this study?Hiba Khan: We did not actually have a very large Asian cohort. Only about 2% of our patients in the cohort were Asian. So it was very difficult to sort of make gene-specific associations and find those trends in the Asian population. What is interesting, though, is that about 10% of the cohort had an unclear race. They were either unknown or it was left completely blank. So I wonder if some of those patients were perhaps other minorities that we weren't capturing. It could include Asian populations, it could have been Native American populations or patients of mixed race ancestry and background that we're not capturing.So, again, it drives home the importance of conducting these kinds of large population-based studies and including race, ethnic background, and similar information so that we can see what the trends are and be able to intervene appropriately if we see that a population's needs aren't being met, to just ensure equitable, both genetic testing, and as you, again, said earlier, just precision-based treatment with PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy.Andrea Miyahira: Can you contrast germline testing with other methods such as polygenic risk score for identifying patients at risk?Hiba Khan: Yes. I think polygenic risk scores are very interesting, and I think we're learning a lot about how we can use them, again, on a very large population-based level. There's some great work being done currently at Fred Hutch Cancer Center to look at how we can use polygenic risk scores in a large population-based manner. I think we're still learning about them, and I think germline genetic testing can be in concert with polygenic risk scores, and we can use them simultaneously.Andrea Miyahira: And what are you and your team doing next in this study?Hiba Khan: I think it'll be really important, actually, to use that really great data to look at treatments and actually outcomes. That's kind of an interest of mine, is to see if we can identify disparities, can we drive a little bit further and see if there are disparities in treatments or disparities in just large populations like we have to see where if it impacts treatment and outcomes in the future. So I think that's one next step of this study. And then in the future, I think we can use all this information we're gathering to hopefully drive some interventions forward to make cancer care and prostate cancer care in general more equitable.Andrea Miyahira: Thanks. What would be your key take-home messages for patients and providers?Hiba Khan: One thing that was really interesting that we found in this study was only a quarter of patients actually had a family history that was coded for. So again, as the guidelines suggest, it just drives home the importance of doing genetic testing, germline genetic testing based on personal prostate cancer history and risk. My ultimate hope is that the more patients we can get tested and screened, not only will they be eligible, potentially, for precision therapies, but we can also screen their family members and loved ones through cascade testing to hopefully find more people who have these germline genetic mutations to impact screening and ultimately the development of prostate cancer and help make a dent in prostate cancer outcomes.Andrea Miyahira: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Khan, for joining me. It was really a pleasure.Hiba Khan: Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Media\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Research Articles\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.urotoday.com//conference-highlights/aua-2024/aua-2024-bladder-cancer/151890-aua-2024-optimal-turbt-do-skilled-urologists-really-need-to-perform-retur-for-all-hg-patients.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Published date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2022-06-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-06-29 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-04-30 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AUA 2024: Optimal TURBT: Do Skilled Urologists Really Need to Perform reTUR for all HG Patients? \\n(UroToday.com)\\u00a0The 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) annual meeting featured the AUA-IBCG Bladder Cancer Forum and a series of presentations by Drs.

Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases.\\u00a0\\nDr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts:\\n\\nConventional TURBT is associated with major limitations\\nSecond/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery\\nIn the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered?\\nA good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease\\n\\nDr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT:\\n\\nAUA:\\n\\nIncomplete resection (Grade B)\\nAll T1 lesions (Grade B)\\nRecurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C)\\n\\n\\nICUD:\\n\\nIncomplete initial resection\\nT1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection\\nHigh grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal\\n\\n\\nEAU (Grade A):\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nAbsence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta)\\nAll high grade Ta and T1 lesions\\n\\n\\nNCCN:\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nT1\\nLarge and multifocal\\nNo muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta\\n\\n\\n\\nThe quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to \\u2265T1) and 0-32% (T1 to \\u2265T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT).\\nDr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001):\\n\\nIs a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology:\\u00a0\\n\\nHistorical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%).\\nDr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions:\\n\\nThere is more complete information up front with re-TURBT\\nThere is better patient selection for BCG\\nIt drives better cystectomy decision making\\nIt improves disease related outcomes\\nIt may improve overall survival\\nEn bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT\\u00a0\\n\\nModerator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC\\nDebaters:\\u00a0\\n\\nJeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\\nBadrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN\\u00a0\\n\\nWritten by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc \\u2013 Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during\\u00a0the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 \\u2013 Mon, May 6, 2024.\\u00a0\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Jeremy Teoh, Neal Shore, and Badrinath Konety discussing whether skill urologists really need to perform re-TUR for all high-grade patients. As moderator, Dr. Shore started by presenting a case of a 65-year-old patient that presented with a solitary 2 cm papillary lesion with surrounding erythema on the lateral wall. His medical history included a two pack per day smoker for 15 years (quit 15 years ago), but he is now vaping, and he is 20 kg overweight. He previously worked in a steel mill and is now a compliance officer for a pharmaceutical company. He eventually underwent a complete resection TURBT, but had a thin bladder wall, as well as a difficult post-anesthesia recovery. Dr. Shore polled the audience with the following question: \\u201cDo skilled urologists really need to perform a re-TUR for all high grade patients?\\u201d with the following results:\\n\\nYes: 28%\\nOnly T1: 55%\\nNo: 17%\\n\\nDr. Teoh started by taking the stance of no need for repeat TURBT. From a surgical perspective, CIS and early cancer changes can be subtle, it can be difficult to determine the resection margin based on white light imaging alone, and difficult to ensure a uniform resection at the detrusor muscle level. Thus, the end result is residual disease. According to the AUA guidelines specific to a repeat TURBT, the following statements are made:\\n\\nGuideline statement 12: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\nGuideline Statement 13: In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C)\\nGuideline Statement 14: In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B)\\n\\nDr. Teoh raised several important questions, including (1) Why do we need a second surgery to compensate for the first surgery? (2) Why do we think that a second surgery would be easier than the first surgery? With en bloc resection of specimens, both circumferential and deep resection margins can be inked and assessed, as well as the depth of tumor invasion be ascertained. Importantly, proper staging and complete tumor resection can be achieved:\\n\\nDr. Teoh was the lead author of a recently published phase 3 randomized trial assessing transurethral en bloc resection versus standard resection of bladder tumors.1 The EB-StaR study was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Hong Kong. There were 350 patients with bladder tumor(s) of \\u22643 cm recruited from April 2017 to December 2020 and followed up until 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was 1-year recurrence rate. Overall 276 patients were confirmed to have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including 143 patients in the en bloc resection group and 133 patients in the standard resection group. At 1 year, 31 patients in the en bloc resection group and 46 in the standard resection group developed recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year recurrence rates was 29% (95% CI 18\\u201337) in the en bloc resection group and 38% (95% CI 28\\u201346) in the standard resection group (p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.007):\\n\\nThe forest plot shows that patients with 1-3 cm tumors, single tumors, Ta disease, or intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer had a significant benefit from en bloc resection:\\n\\nDr. Teoh notes that the modified ERBT study is a phase 2 single arm study using modified en block resection. Key inclusion criteria include bladder tumors >= 3 cm, and assuming a >90% rate of complete resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 30 patients were to be recruited. The primary outcome is complete resection and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04081246). One case example from this trial is as follows:\\n\\nAmong 28 cases of modified en bloc resection, one case of prostate cancer was excluded, finding 15 cases of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (with 14 cases of complete resection \\u2013 93.3%), and 12 cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (11 had proper staging of muscle invasive disease at the first surgery \\u2013 91.7%). Ultimately 8 patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, with four patients having T2 disease ultimately having T0 disease on final pathologic staging. The remaining four patients had pT3 disease. Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases.\\u00a0\\nDr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts:\\n\\nConventional TURBT is associated with major limitations\\nSecond/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery\\nIn the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered?\\nA good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease\\n\\nDr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT:\\n\\nAUA:\\n\\nIncomplete resection (Grade B)\\nAll T1 lesions (Grade B)\\nRecurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C)\\n\\n\\nICUD:\\n\\nIncomplete initial resection\\nT1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection\\nHigh grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal\\n\\n\\nEAU (Grade A):\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nAbsence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta)\\nAll high grade Ta and T1 lesions\\n\\n\\nNCCN:\\n\\nIncomplete resection\\nT1\\nLarge and multifocal\\nNo muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta\\n\\n\\n\\nThe quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to \\u2265T1) and 0-32% (T1 to \\u2265T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT).\\nDr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001):\\n\\nIs a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology:\\u00a0\\n\\nHistorical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%).\\nDr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions:\\n\\nThere is more complete information up front with re-TURBT\\nThere is better patient selection for BCG\\nIt drives better cystectomy decision making\\nIt improves disease related outcomes\\nIt may improve overall survival\\nEn bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT\\u00a0\\n\\nModerator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC\\nDebaters:\\u00a0\\n\\nJeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\\nBadrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN\\u00a0\\n\\nWritten by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc \\u2013 Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during\\u00a0the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 \\u2013 Mon, May 6, 2024.\\u00a0\\n\",\n          \"Quantifying Intrafraction Motion and the Impact of Gating for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Stereotactic Radiation therapy for Prostate Cancer: Analysis of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Arm From the MIRAGE Phase 3 Randomized Trial. Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"BRCA2 and Beyond: Unraveling Genetic Drivers of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - Hiba Khan Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer. Dr. Khan's study, leveraging data from Invitae, explores genetic testing results linked to medical records to identify gene-specific associations and potential disparities in testing among diverse populations. Key findings reveal that BRCA2 is the most common mutation across all demographics and is associated with advanced disease, while BRCA1 and MMR mutations are often linked to less aggressive prostate cancer and detected before diagnosis. Notably, only 25% of patients had a documented family history prompting genetic testing, underscoring the need for broader screening based on personal cancer history. Dr. Khan emphasizes the importance of large, inclusive studies to ensure equitable access to genetic testing and targeted therapies, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities in prostate cancer care.  Biographies:Hiba Khan, MD, MPH, GU Medical Oncologist, Assistant Professor, Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAndrea K. Miyahira, PhD, Director of Global Research & Scientific Communications, The Prostate Cancer Foundation Andrea Miyahira: Hi everyone. I'm Andrea Miyahira here at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Joining me today is Dr. Hiba Khan, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Khan just presented a poster at ASCO on germline genetic associations in a large prostate cancer cohort. Dr. Khan, thanks so much for joining us today.Hiba Khan: Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here.Andrea Miyahira: Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable types of cancer, with over 50% having a genetic component. Many DNA repair mutations have been identified in the germline, most commonly BRCA2, and this has led to recommendations for all patients with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer to receive germline testing. This is important so that patients can know whether they're eligible for PARP inhibitors, but also to trigger cascade genetic testing. So, what were you specifically looking at in this study?Hiba Khan: In this study, we wanted to take advantage of a large database that was available to us through Invitae, which is one of the largest companies that does germline genetic testing commercially. They had great linkage with a medical records database that allowed us to access coding records along with genetic testing results, and there was a linkage between them. The idea for the study was to see if we could identify some gene-specific associations, including things like population trends, demographic trends, and perhaps geographic distributions that could give us some idea of populations that were perhaps being left behind in testing or to get a broader equity, diversity lens to see where we can make the most impact for the most populations.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. Can you describe the patient cohort, including the racial and ethnic demographics, how patients were selected, and how germline testing was done?Hiba Khan: Yes. This was commercial testing, so they had results for most of the genetic testing that they had done. Any patient that had a prostate cancer code and had undergone genetic testing was included in the cohort. The cohort was predominantly an older population. The median age was 64. The patients were primarily of white background; 66% were white. We had 11% Black or African American ancestry, and about 4% were Hispanic or identified as Latino.Andrea Miyahira: What were your major findings on pathogenic germline alterations? Was there anything that surprised you?Hiba Khan: Yes, the major finding was, I would say, not a surprising one, which, as you stated earlier, BRCA2 is known to be a very common heritable mutation that can serve as a driver for prostate cancer. And so that was the most common mutation we found across all racial ethnic groups and geographic distributions. We also found that BRCA2 was associated with more advanced and metastatic disease, also not a surprising finding.There were a couple of findings that were interesting to me. One of those was that patients with BRCA1 and MMR mutations actually tended to have less aggressive disease. In addition, those patients with BRCA1 and MMR gene mutations, many of them were screened before their prostate cancer diagnosis. So they were found to have had these mutations and then later subsequently developed prostate cancer. So those two things in combination make me think: were those patients perhaps getting screened for prostate cancer more than the average population? Those were a couple of surprising findings. The other major finding was that only a quarter, or 25%, of our patients in the cohort had a code for family history of prostate cancer, which drove the genetic testing. The rest of the patients were screened based on only personal history of prostate cancer.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. We've seen in studies from Asia that driver alterations can be significantly different than studies performed in predominantly European ancestry populations. So what was the frequency of Asian and other underrepresented populations in this study?Hiba Khan: We did not actually have a very large Asian cohort. Only about 2% of our patients in the cohort were Asian. So it was very difficult to sort of make gene-specific associations and find those trends in the Asian population. What is interesting, though, is that about 10% of the cohort had an unclear race. They were either unknown or it was left completely blank. So I wonder if some of those patients were perhaps other minorities that we weren't capturing. It could include Asian populations, it could have been Native American populations or patients of mixed race ancestry and background that we're not capturing.So, again, it drives home the importance of conducting these kinds of large population-based studies and including race, ethnic background, and similar information so that we can see what the trends are and be able to intervene appropriately if we see that a population's needs aren't being met, to just ensure equitable, both genetic testing, and as you, again, said earlier, just precision-based treatment with PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy.Andrea Miyahira: Can you contrast germline testing with other methods such as polygenic risk score for identifying patients at risk?Hiba Khan: Yes. I think polygenic risk scores are very interesting, and I think we're learning a lot about how we can use them, again, on a very large population-based level. There's some great work being done currently at Fred Hutch Cancer Center to look at how we can use polygenic risk scores in a large population-based manner. I think we're still learning about them, and I think germline genetic testing can be in concert with polygenic risk scores, and we can use them simultaneously.Andrea Miyahira: And what are you and your team doing next in this study?Hiba Khan: I think it'll be really important, actually, to use that really great data to look at treatments and actually outcomes. That's kind of an interest of mine, is to see if we can identify disparities, can we drive a little bit further and see if there are disparities in treatments or disparities in just large populations like we have to see where if it impacts treatment and outcomes in the future. So I think that's one next step of this study. And then in the future, I think we can use all this information we're gathering to hopefully drive some interventions forward to make cancer care and prostate cancer care in general more equitable.Andrea Miyahira: Thanks. What would be your key take-home messages for patients and providers?Hiba Khan: One thing that was really interesting that we found in this study was only a quarter of patients actually had a family history that was coded for. So again, as the guidelines suggest, it just drives home the importance of doing genetic testing, germline genetic testing based on personal prostate cancer history and risk. My ultimate hope is that the more patients we can get tested and screened, not only will they be eligible, potentially, for precision therapies, but we can also screen their family members and loved ones through cascade testing to hopefully find more people who have these germline genetic mutations to impact screening and ultimately the development of prostate cancer and help make a dent in prostate cancer outcomes.Andrea Miyahira: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Khan, for joining me. It was really a pleasure.Hiba Khan: Thank you very much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Media\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Research Articles\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Published date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2022-06-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-06-29 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-04-30 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"@SuyogCancer @VPrasadMDMPH Difference might be trial design , cross over etc \\nWill have to look at details \\n\\nIf progression while on Opdivo - I would do Platinum + Gem or EV alone \\n\\nIf progression &gt; 6 months post Opdivo than EV/ Pembro\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Twitter\",\n          \"Media\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Media Sources\",\n          \"Research Articles\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Published date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2022-06-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-06-29 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 52,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-04-09 00:00:00\",\n          \"2024-05-24 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC \\u22640.9 and GDC \\u22640.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic. Real-time tracking/gating effectively mitigated this motion and is likely a major contributing factor of acute toxicity reduction associated with MRgRT.\",\n          \"@SuyogCancer @VPrasadMDMPH Difference might be trial design , cross over etc \\nWill have to look at details \\n\\nIf progression while on Opdivo - I would do Platinum + Gem or EV alone \\n\\nIf progression &gt; 6 months post Opdivo than EV/ Pembro\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Drugs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Cabozantinib, Nivolumab\",\n          \"Hexaminolevulinate\",\n          \"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Diseases\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Breast cancer, Cancer, Lesion\",\n          \"Breast cancer, Cancer, Fine-needle aspiration, Mastectomy, Radical mastectomy\",\n          \"Breast cancer, Cancer, Triple-negative breast cancer\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Study\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Error\",\n          \"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Efficacy-General\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Progression Free Survival (PFS)\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall Survival (OS)\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Safety-General\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Safety-Side Effects\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"General Opinion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Others\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
